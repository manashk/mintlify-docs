## Dashboard Overview

The analytics dashboard provides real-time visibility into your calling operations:

    subgraph "📊 Dashboard Metrics"
        A["Total Calls"]
        B["Avg Duration"]
        C["Total Cost"]
        D["Cost per Call"]
    end
    
    subgraph "📈 Time Series"
        E["Call Volume\nover Time"]
    end
    
    subgraph "🍩 Breakdowns"
        F["Disposition\nDonut Chart"]

## Key Metrics

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Call Volume" icon="phone">
    Total inbound + outbound calls over the selected time period. Filterable by agent, call type, and date range.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Average Duration" icon="clock">
    Mean call length in seconds. Useful for identifying agents that need prompt tuning.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Total Cost" icon="dollar-sign">
    Combined LLM + STT + TTS + platform costs across all calls.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Disposition Analysis" icon="chart-pie">
    Breakdown of call outcomes: successful transfer, hung up, voicemail, do-not-call, etc.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Cost Tracking

Every call includes a detailed cost breakdown:

| Metric | Source | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **LLM Cost** | Token count × model pricing | Input + output tokens |
| **STT Cost** | Audio duration × provider pricing | Seconds of speech recognized |
| **TTS Cost** | Character count × provider pricing | Characters synthesized to speech |
| **Platform Cost** | Fixed surcharge | Per-call platform fee |
| **Total Cost** | Sum of all above | Complete call cost |

<Info>Cost calculation happens automatically during the post-call teardown phase. Pricing rates are embedded in the cost computation logic.</Info>
