## Overview

Campaigns provide a simplified way to manage outbound calling lists. Unlike batch jobs (which use Celery for distributed processing), campaigns execute via background tasks for simpler use cases.

## Creating a Campaign

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Campaign">
    Go to **Campaigns** → **Create New**. Provide:
    - Campaign name
    - Description
    - Agent phone number (determines which agent handles calls)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Phone Numbers">
    Two options:

    **Option A: CSV Import**
    - Upload a CSV with phone numbers
    - Duplicate numbers are automatically removed

    **Option B: Manual Entry**
    - Add numbers one at a time
    - Edit or remove individual numbers
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Campaign">
    Click **Start Campaign**. The system begins calling each number sequentially using the configured agent.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    View the campaign status page to see:
    - Overall progress (total, called, remaining)
    - Per-number call status
    - Link to individual call logs
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Campaigns vs. Batch Jobs

| Feature | Campaigns | Batch Jobs |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Execution Engine** | FastAPI BackgroundTasks | Celery (distributed) |
| **Scheduling** | No | Yes (Celery Beat) |
| **Concurrency Control** | No | Yes (Redis semaphore) |
| **Per-Item Tracking** | Basic (called/not called) | Detailed (pending/calling/completed/failed) |
| **Retry on Failure** | No | Yes (auto-retry ×3) |
| **Persistence** | Lost if process restarts | Survives restarts |
| **Best For** | Small lists (< 50 numbers) | Large-scale calling (100+ numbers) |

<Info>For production outbound calling at scale, use **Batch Jobs** instead of Campaigns. Campaigns are better suited for small, ad-hoc calling lists.</Info>

## Campaign Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `created` | Campaign exists but hasn't started |
| `running` | Currently executing calls |
| `completed` | All numbers have been called |
