## Overview

API keys provide a way to authenticate server-to-server requests without user session cookies. Each key is scoped to a single workspace and has a defined permission level.

## Creating an API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Go to **Workspace Settings** → **API Keys**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Key">
    Click **Create API Key**. Provide:
    - **Name:** A descriptive label (e.g., "Production Integration")
    - **Role:** Permission level — Member (read-only) or Developer (read-write)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the Key">
    The API key is shown **once**. Copy and store it securely.
    
    <Warning>The key value is hashed in the database and cannot be retrieved after creation. If lost, delete and create a new key.</Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using API Keys

Include the key in the `x-api-key` header:

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl -X GET "https://api.vaani.ai/agents" \
  -H "x-api-key: vk_live_abc123def456"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.vaani.ai/agents",
    headers={"x-api-key": "vk_live_abc123def456"}
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://api.vaani.ai/agents", {
  headers: { "x-api-key": "vk_live_abc123def456" }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## API Key vs JWT

| Feature | API Key | JWT Cookie |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Use case** | Server-to-server, integrations | Dashboard, browser |
| **Workspace** | Fixed to key's workspace | User's active workspace |
| **Expiration** | No expiration | 15 minutes (auto-refresh) |
| **Rotation** | Manual (delete + create) | Automatic refresh |
| **Multi-workspace** | One key per workspace | Switch via header |

---

## Managing Keys

### List Keys

**`GET /api-keys`**

Returns key metadata (name, created date, role). Does **not** return the key value.

### Delete Key

**`DELETE /api-keys/{key_id}`**

Immediately revokes the key. All requests using this key will fail with `401`.

<Info>There is no limit on the number of API keys per workspace. Create separate keys for different integrations to enable independent revocation.</Info>

---

## Security Best Practices

- **Never expose keys in client-side code** — API keys are for server-to-server use only
- **Use separate keys per integration** — easier to rotate and revoke independently
- **Use the minimum role** — prefer "Member" role for read-only integrations
- **Rotate keys periodically** — delete old keys and create new ones
- **Monitor usage** — check call logs for API key-originated requests
