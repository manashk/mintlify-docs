## What Are API Keys?

API keys let you connect your own applications, CRMs, or automation tools to Vaani — without logging into the dashboard. Each key is tied to a single workspace and has defined permissions.

## Creating an API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Go to **Workspace Settings** → **API Keys**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Key">
    Click **Create API Key**. Provide:
    - **Name:** A descriptive label (e.g., "CRM Integration", "Zapier Connector")
    - **Role:** Permission level — **Member** (read-only) or **Developer** (read-write)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the Key">
    The API key is shown **once**. Copy and store it securely.
    
    <Warning>The key cannot be retrieved after you leave this page. If lost, delete the key and create a new one.</Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Keys

- **View keys:** Go to **Workspace Settings** → **API Keys** to see all active keys (name, role, creation date)
- **Delete a key:** Click the delete button next to any key to revoke it immediately. All systems using that key will stop working.

<Info>There is no limit on the number of API keys per workspace. Create separate keys for different integrations so you can revoke them independently.</Info>

## Best Practices

- **Use separate keys** for each integration — makes it easy to revoke one without affecting others
- **Choose the minimum role needed** — use "Member" for read-only integrations
- **Never put keys in client-side code** — API keys should only be used from your backend servers
- **Rotate keys regularly** — delete old keys and create new replacements
- **Monitor for misuse** — check call logs for unexpected activity from API key-authenticated requests
