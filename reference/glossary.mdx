## A–D

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Agent** | An AI-powered virtual assistant that handles phone calls or web chats. Defined by ~50 configuration fields. |
| **Agent Worker** | The LiveKit Agents process that executes real-time voice conversations. Runs `agent.py:entrypoint()`. |
| **AgentCaller** | The class extending `livekit.agents.Agent` that implements conversation logic, tool functions, and call transfers. |
| **Batch Job** | A collection of phone numbers (uploaded via CSV) to be called sequentially/in-parallel by a specific agent. |
| **Batch Item** | A single phone number within a batch job, with its own status tracking (pending → calling → completed/failed). |
| **Campaign** | A simplified outbound calling list, executed via BackgroundTasks (not Celery). Best for small-scale calls. |
| **Celery** | Distributed task queue used for batch call dispatching and scheduled tasks. Uses Redis as broker. |
| **Cold Transfer** | Call transfer where the caller is immediately connected to the target without agent briefing. |
| **Custom Function** | A webhook-based tool that the agent can invoke during a conversation (e.g., check inventory, book appointment). |
| **Dispatch Rule** | A LiveKit SIP configuration that routes incoming calls on a trunk to an available agent worker. |
| **Disposition** | The AI-determined outcome/result category of a call (e.g., "successful-transfer", "hung-up", "do-not-call"). |
| **Dynamic Variables** | Template variables (e.g., `{{customer_name}}`) in system prompts replaced at runtime with per-call data. |

## E–L

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Egress** | LiveKit's recording service that captures audio from rooms and uploads to S3 as `.ogg` files. |
| **E.164** | International phone number format with `+` prefix and country code (e.g., `+16505551234`). |
| **Entrypoint** | The `entrypoint()` async function in `agent.py` — the main lifecycle handler for every voice call. |
| **Factory Pattern** | Design pattern used by `LLMFactory`, `STTFactory`, `TTSFactory` to create provider-specific instances. |
| **First Message** | The greeting the agent delivers via TTS when a call connects. |
| **Inbound Trunk** | A LiveKit SIP trunk configured to receive incoming calls from PSTN/telephony providers. |
| **JWT** | JSON Web Token — used for user authentication. Stored as `access_token` cookie; signed with HS256. |
| **Knowledge Base** | A collection of documents uploaded to an agent for RAG-based retrieval during conversations. |
| **LiveKit** | Open-source real-time communication platform providing WebRTC, SIP gateway, and Agents SDK. |
| **LLM** | Large Language Model — the AI model powering the agent's conversation (e.g., GPT-4o, Groq Llama-3). |

## M–R

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Outbound Trunk** | A LiveKit SIP trunk used to initiate outgoing calls to PSTN numbers. |
| **Platform Cost** | An additional per-call cost charged by Vaani on top of AI provider costs. |
| **Pre-signed URL** | A time-limited S3 URL for accessing call recordings without AWS credentials (expires after 1 hour). |
| **PSTN** | Public Switched Telephone Network — the traditional phone system. |
| **RAG** | Retrieval-Augmented Generation — LLM technique where relevant documents are retrieved and injected into the prompt. |
| **RBAC** | Role-Based Access Control — authorization system with admin/developer/member roles per workspace. |

## S–Z

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **SFU** | Selective Forwarding Unit — LiveKit's media routing architecture for WebRTC. |
| **SIP** | Session Initiation Protocol — standard for voice call signaling over IP networks. |
| **STT** | Speech-to-Text — converts spoken audio to text. Providers: Deepgram, Sarvam, Cartesia. |
| **Superuser** | A platform-level admin flag granting access to all workspaces and the admin panel. |
| **System Prompt** | The instructions that define the agent's personality, behavior, and rules. |
| **TTS** | Text-to-Speech — converts text to spoken audio. 8 supported providers. |
| **Turn Detection** | VAD-based algorithm that detects when a user has finished speaking, triggering the agent's response. |
| **VAD** | Voice Activity Detection — detects human speech in audio streams to determine speech boundaries. |
| **VUI Widget** | Voice User Interface widget — embeddable React component connecting to agents via WebRTC. |
| **Warm Transfer** | Call transfer where the agent briefs the target party (delivering a summary) before connecting the caller. |
| **Workspace** | A multi-tenant organizational unit. All data (agents, calls, SIP trunks) is scoped to a workspace. |
