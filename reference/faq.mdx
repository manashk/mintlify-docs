## General

### What is Vaani?
Vaani is a multi-tenant SaaS platform for building, deploying, and managing AI-powered voice agents that handle phone calls in real-time.

### Who is it for?
- **Businesses** wanting to automate phone support, appointment scheduling, and outbound campaigns
- **Developers** building voice AI integrations
- **Contact centers** augmenting human agents with AI assistants

### What languages are supported?
Depends on the STT/TTS providers:
- **Deepgram:** 36+ languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese
- **Sarvam:** Indian languages (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, etc.)
- **OpenAI:** Multiple languages via TTS

Language is configured per-agent via the `STT_language` setting.

## Features

### How many concurrent calls can the system handle?
Controlled by the `MAX_AGENT_SESSIONS` environment variable. The webhook handler tracks LiveKit room events to maintain a real-time count. Batch dispatch automatically throttles when at capacity.

### Can I use my own phone numbers?
Yes. Use the **Register SIP Trunk** feature to connect existing phone numbers from any SIP-compatible provider.

### Does the agent remember previous conversations?
Each call is a separate session. The agent does not have memory across calls by default. However, you can pass context via dynamic variables to provide per-call information.

### Can agents query external APIs during calls?
Yes, via **Custom Functions**. Configure webhook-based tools that the agent can invoke during conversations (e.g., check stock, look up orders, book appointments).

### Is there billing/payment integration?
Basic cost tracking exists per call (LLM + STT + TTS + platform costs). Users have a `credit` field, but active billing enforcement and payment gateway integration are not fully implemented yet.

## Technical

### How do I add a new AI provider?
See the [Extending Providers](/developer-guide/extending-providers) guide. In short: install the LiveKit plugin, add a branch to the relevant factory class, and configure the API key.

### How do I add a new API endpoint?
1. Create/modify a router file in `app/router/`
2. Add auth dependency: `Depends(require_workspace_access(WorkspaceRole.developer))`
3. Create Pydantic schemas in `app/db/schemas/`
4. Register the router in `app/main.py`

### How do I add a database model?
1. Create a model in `app/db/models/`
2. Generate migration: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"`
3. Apply: `alembic upgrade head`

### What's the difference between Batch Jobs and Campaigns?
**Batch Jobs** use Celery (distributed, persistent, retry support, concurrency control). **Campaigns** use FastAPI BackgroundTasks (simpler, no retry, lost on restart). Use Batch Jobs for production workloads.

### Where are call recordings stored?
AWS S3, at path `mv/{YYYY}/{MM}/{DD}/{call_log_id}.ogg`. The backend generates pre-signed URLs (1-hour expiry) for playback.

## Debugging

### The agent isn't picking up calls. What's wrong?
1. Verify agent worker is running and connected to LiveKit
2. Check `LIVEKIT_URL` and API key configuration
3. Verify the phone number has SIP trunks configured
4. Check `livekit:active_calls` Redis counter — might be at `MAX_AGENT_SESSIONS`
5. Check agent worker logs for connection errors

### How do I reset the active calls counter?
```bash
redis-cli SET livekit:active_calls 0
```
The counter has a 600-second TTL safety net but may need manual reset after crashes.

### JWT authentication is failing. How do I debug?
1. Check that `JWT_API_SECRET` is identical in backend and UI
2. Verify `access_token` cookie is present in browser dev tools
3. Check if token is expired (15-minute default lifetime)
4. Ensure CORS settings allow credentials from the UI domain

## Integration

### Can I use the API without the dashboard?
Yes. Use API key authentication for server-to-server access. See [API Keys](/security/api-keys).

### Is there a Postman collection?
Not yet. The Swagger/OpenAPI spec is available at `https://api.vaani.ai/docs`. You can import this into Postman.

### Can I embed the voice agent on my website?
Yes. The VUI Widget is an embeddable React component. Include it on any page to enable web-based voice interaction with your agents without phone infrastructure.
