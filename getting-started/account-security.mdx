## Signing Up

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your account">
    Go to the Vaani dashboard and click **Sign Up**. You can register with:
    - **Email & password** — fill in your name, email, and a secure password
    - **Google** — click "Sign in with Google" for one-click access
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a workspace">
    After signing in, you'll be prompted to create your first workspace. Give it a name (e.g., "My Company") — this is your team's organizational unit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start using Vaani">
    You're now an **Admin** of your workspace. Head to the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) to create your first agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Logging In

- Navigate to the Vaani dashboard and enter your **email** and **password**
- Or click **Sign in with Google** if you registered via Google
- Your session stays active automatically — the platform handles token refresh behind the scenes

<Tip>If you forget your password, click **Forgot Password** on the login page. You'll receive a reset link via email.</Tip>

## Understanding Roles

Every workspace member has a role that determines what they can do:

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| **Member** | View agents, call logs, reports, and analytics |
| **Developer** | All Member permissions + create/edit agents, phone numbers, campaigns, batch jobs, and API keys |
| **Admin** | All Developer permissions + manage workspace settings, invite/remove members, purchase phone numbers |

<Info>You can belong to **multiple workspaces**, each with a different role. Use the workspace switcher in the dashboard to change your active workspace.</Info>

## Inviting Team Members

If you're an **Admin**, you can invite others to your workspace:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Workspace Settings">
    Click **Settings** → **Members** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invite a member">
    Enter their email address and choose a role (**Member**, **Developer**, or **Admin**).
  </Step>
  <Step title="They join">
    The invited user will receive access to the workspace once they log in.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API Keys

API keys let you connect external systems (like your CRM or custom backend) to Vaani without using the dashboard.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to API Keys">
    Navigate to **Workspace Settings** → **API Keys**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a key">
    Click **Create API Key**. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "CRM Integration") and choose a permission level:
    - **Member** — read-only access
    - **Developer** — read and write access
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy and save">
    The key is shown **only once**. Copy it and store it securely.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>If you lose an API key, you'll need to delete it and create a new one. The key value cannot be retrieved after creation.</Warning>

### Best Practices

- **Use separate keys** for each integration — makes it easy to revoke one without affecting others
- **Use the minimum role** — choose "Member" for read-only integrations
- **Never share keys** in public code, emails, or chat messages
- **Rotate keys periodically** — delete old ones and create new replacements

## Security Tips

- **Use a strong password** — at least 12 characters with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
- **Don't share your login credentials** with other team members — invite them instead
- **Review workspace members regularly** — remove anyone who no longer needs access
- **Monitor your call logs** — unexpected activity may indicate unauthorized API key usage
