## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up & Create a Workspace">
    1. Navigate to the Vaani dashboard and create an account
    2. After signing in, you'll be prompted to create your first **workspace**
    3. Give it a name (e.g., "My Company") — this is your team's organizational unit
    4. You'll be assigned the **Admin** role automatically
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Your First Agent">
    1. Go to **Agents** in the sidebar
    2. Click **Create Agent**
    3. Configure the basics:

    | Setting | Recommended Value | Description |
    |---------|------------------|-------------|
    | Agent Name | "Sales Assistant" | Display name for your agent |
    | LLM Provider | OpenAI | Language model provider |
    | LLM Model | gpt-4o | Best balance of speed and quality |
    | STT Provider | Deepgram | Speech-to-Text provider |
    | TTS Provider | ElevenLabs | Text-to-Speech provider |
    | System Prompt | "You are a helpful sales assistant for Acme Corp..." | Instructions for the agent |
    | First Message | "Hello! Thanks for calling Acme Corp. How can I help you today?" | Greeting when call connects |

    4. Click **Save**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect a Phone Number">
    1. Go to **Phone Numbers** in the sidebar
    2. Click **Purchase Number**
    3. Select a provider (Twilio or Vonage) and country
    4. Choose an available number and click **Purchase**
    5. The system automatically creates SIP trunks (inbound + outbound) on LiveKit
    6. Click **Map to Agent** and select your agent

    <Info>The purchased number is now routed through LiveKit SIP to your AI agent. Any inbound call to this number will be handled automatically.</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make a Test Call">
    You have two options:

    **Option A: Web Call (from the dashboard)**
    - Go to your agent's page and click **Test Call**
    - This opens a web-based voice session via LiveKit WebRTC

    **Option B: Phone Call**
    - Dial the phone number you just purchased from any phone
    - You'll hear your agent's first message and can start a conversation
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Call Analytics">
    1. After the call ends, go to **Call Logs** in the sidebar
    2. You'll see the call with:
       - Duration, cost breakdown (LLM + STT + TTS)
       - Full conversation transcript
       - AI-generated call analysis (sentiment, summary, disposition)
       - Recording playback
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick API Test

If you prefer API-first, here's how to initiate an outbound call:

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl -X POST "https://api.vaani.ai/calls/outbound_call" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: access_token=YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "agent_phone_number": "+16505551234",
    "phone_number_to_dial": "+14155559876",
    "dynamic_variables": {
      "customer_name": "John",
      "appointment_date": "2026-02-15"
    }
  }'
```

```json Response
{
  "call_uuid": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "dynamic_variables": {
    "customer_name": "John",
    "appointment_date": "2026-02-15"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
