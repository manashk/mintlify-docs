## Development

### How do I add a new AI provider (LLM/STT/TTS)?

1. Add `livekit-plugins-{provider}` dependency to `requirements.txt`
2. Update the relevant factory class:
   - LLM: `plugins/llm.py` → `LLMFactory.get_instance()`
   - STT: `plugins/stt.py` → `STTFactory.get_instance()`
   - TTS: `plugins/tts.py` → `TTSFactory.get_instance()`
3. Add a new conditional branch matching the provider name
4. Configure the API key in `settings.py` and `.env`
5. Update the `Agents` model if new config fields are needed
6. Update UI dropdowns in agent creation forms

### How do I add a new API endpoint?

1. Create or modify a router file in `app/router/`
2. Define the endpoint: `@router.get/post/put/delete`
3. Add auth: `workspace_id = Depends(require_workspace_access(WorkspaceRole.developer))`
4. Create Pydantic schemas in `app/db/schemas/`
5. Register in `app/main.py`: `app.include_router(new_router)`

### How do I add a custom function (tool) to the agent?

Custom functions are configured per-agent via the `custom_functions` JSON column:

```json
{
  "name": "check_inventory",
  "description": "Check if a product is in stock",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/check",
  "method": "POST",
  "parameters": {
    "product_id": {"type": "string", "description": "Product ID"}
  },
  "speak_during": "Let me check that for you",
  "speak_after": "I have the result"
}
```

The `AgentCaller` registers these as `@function_tool` methods at runtime via `utils/dynamic_tools.py`.

## Architecture

### What's the difference between Batch Jobs and Campaigns?

| Aspect | Batch Jobs | Campaigns |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Execution** | Celery (distributed) | BackgroundTasks (in-process) |
| **Scheduling** | Yes (Celery Beat) | No |
| **Concurrency** | Redis semaphore | No |
| **Per-item Status** | Detailed | Basic |
| **Retry** | Celery auto-retry | No |

### What happens when a call comes in?

1. PSTN call → Twilio/Vonage → SIP to LiveKit
2. LiveKit dispatch rule matches the phone number's inbound trunk
3. New LiveKit room created
4. Agent worker picks up via `entrypoint()`
5. Worker loads agent config from PostgreSQL
6. Conversation begins (STT → LLM → TTS loop)
7. After call: recording to S3, call log to PostgreSQL

### Where are call recordings stored?

S3 at path `mv/{YYYY}/{MM}/{DD}/{call_log_id}.ogg`. Backend generates pre-signed URLs (1hr expiry) for playback.

## Debugging & Support

### How do I debug a failed batch job?

1. Check status: `GET /batch/{batch_id}`
2. Look at individual item errors in `batch_items` table
3. Check Celery logs: `docker-compose logs celery-worker`
4. Common issues: Redis unreachable, capacity limit hit, SIP errors

### The agent isn't picking up calls. What's wrong?

1. Verify agent worker is running and connected to LiveKit
2. Check `LIVEKIT_URL` and API key configuration
3. Verify phone number has SIP trunks configured
4. Check Redis `livekit:active_calls` — might be at `MAX_AGENT_SESSIONS` limit
5. Check agent worker logs for connection errors

### How do I reset the active calls counter?

```bash
redis-cli SET livekit:active_calls 0
```

This key has a 600-second TTL as a safety net.

## Product

### How many concurrent calls can the system handle?

Controlled by `MAX_AGENT_SESSIONS` environment variable. The webhook handler tracks room events to maintain a count.

### What languages are supported?

Depends on the configured STT/TTS providers:
- **Deepgram:** 36+ languages
- **Sarvam:** Indian languages (Hindi, Tamil, etc.)
- **OpenAI:** Multiple via TTS, limited STT languages
- Language is configured per-agent via `STT_language` field

### Is there billing/metering?

Basic cost tracking per call (LLM, STT, TTS, platform costs). No integrated billing or payment gateway. Users have a `credit` field but it's not actively enforced.
