## What is Vaani?

Vaani is a **multi-tenant SaaS platform** for creating AI voice agents that conduct real-time phone conversations. 
Your agents can answer inbound calls, make outbound calls, transfer to humans, query knowledge bases, 
and execute custom actions — all powered by configurable LLM, Speech-to-Text, and Text-to-Speech providers.
